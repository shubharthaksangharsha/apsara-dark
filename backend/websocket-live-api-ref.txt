Live API - WebSockets API reference


Preview: The Live API is in preview.
The Live API is a stateful API that uses WebSockets. In this section, you'll find additional details regarding the WebSockets API.

Sessions
A WebSocket connection establishes a session between the client and the Gemini server. After a client initiates a new connection the session can exchange messages with the server to:

Send text, audio, or video to the Gemini server.
Receive audio, text, or function call requests from the Gemini server.
WebSocket connection
To start a session, connect to this websocket endpoint:


wss://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/ws/google.ai.generativelanguage.v1beta.GenerativeService.BidiGenerateContent
Note: The URL is for version v1beta.
Session configuration
The initial message sent after establishing the WebSocket connection sets the session configuration, which includes the model, generation parameters, system instructions, and tools.

You cannot update the configuration while the connection is open. However, you can change the configuration parameters, except the model, when pausing and resuming via the session resumption mechanism.

See the following example configuration. Note that the name casing in SDKs may vary. You can look up the Python SDK configuration options here.



{
  "model": string,
  "generationConfig": {
    "candidateCount": integer,
    "maxOutputTokens": integer,
    "temperature": number,
    "topP": number,
    "topK": integer,
    "presencePenalty": number,
    "frequencyPenalty": number,
    "responseModalities": [string],
    "speechConfig": object,
    "mediaResolution": object
  },
  "systemInstruction": string,
  "tools": [object]
}
For more information on the API field, see generationConfig.

Send messages
To exchange messages over the WebSocket connection, the client must send a JSON object over an open WebSocket connection. The JSON object must have exactly one of the fields from the following object set:



{
  "setup": BidiGenerateContentSetup,
  "clientContent": BidiGenerateContentClientContent,
  "realtimeInput": BidiGenerateContentRealtimeInput,
  "toolResponse": BidiGenerateContentToolResponse
}
Supported client messages
See the supported client messages in the following table:

Message	Description
BidiGenerateContentSetup	Session configuration to be sent in the first message
BidiGenerateContentClientContent	Incremental content update of the current conversation delivered from the client
BidiGenerateContentRealtimeInput	Real time audio, video, or text input
BidiGenerateContentToolResponse	Response to a ToolCallMessage received from the server
Receive messages
To receive messages from Gemini, listen for the WebSocket 'message' event, and then parse the result according to the definition of the supported server messages.

See the following:


async with client.aio.live.connect(model='...', config=config) as session:
    await session.send(input='Hello world!', end_of_turn=True)
    async for message in session.receive():
        print(message)
Server messages may have a usageMetadata field but will otherwise include exactly one of the other fields from the BidiGenerateContentServerMessage message. (The messageType union is not expressed in JSON so the field will appear at the top-level of the message.)

Messages and events
ActivityEnd
This type has no fields.

Marks the end of user activity.

ActivityHandling
The different ways of handling user activity.

Enums
ACTIVITY_HANDLING_UNSPECIFIED	If unspecified, the default behavior is START_OF_ACTIVITY_INTERRUPTS.
START_OF_ACTIVITY_INTERRUPTS	If true, start of activity will interrupt the model's response (also called "barge in"). The model's current response will be cut-off in the moment of the interruption. This is the default behavior.
NO_INTERRUPTION	The model's response will not be interrupted.
ActivityStart
This type has no fields.

Marks the start of user activity.

AudioTranscriptionConfig
This type has no fields.

The audio transcription configuration.

AutomaticActivityDetection
Configures automatic detection of activity.

Fields
disabled	
bool

Optional. If enabled (the default), detected voice and text input count as activity. If disabled, the client must send activity signals.

startOfSpeechSensitivity	
StartSensitivity

Optional. Determines how likely speech is to be detected.

prefixPaddingMs	
int32

Optional. The required duration of detected speech before start-of-speech is committed. The lower this value, the more sensitive the start-of-speech detection is and shorter speech can be recognized. However, this also increases the probability of false positives.

endOfSpeechSensitivity	
EndSensitivity

Optional. Determines how likely detected speech is ended.

silenceDurationMs	
int32

Optional. The required duration of detected non-speech (e.g. silence) before end-of-speech is committed. The larger this value, the longer speech gaps can be without interrupting the user's activity but this will increase the model's latency.

BidiGenerateContentClientContent
Incremental update of the current conversation delivered from the client. All of the content here is unconditionally appended to the conversation history and used as part of the prompt to the model to generate content.

A message here will interrupt any current model generation.

Fields
turns[]	
Content

Optional. The content appended to the current conversation with the model.

For single-turn queries, this is a single instance. For multi-turn queries, this is a repeated field that contains conversation history and the latest request.

turnComplete	
bool

Optional. If true, indicates that the server content generation should start with the currently accumulated prompt. Otherwise, the server awaits additional messages before starting generation.

BidiGenerateContentRealtimeInput
User input that is sent in real time.

The different modalities (audio, video and text) are handled as concurrent streams. The ordering across these streams is not guaranteed.

This is different from BidiGenerateContentClientContent in a few ways:

Can be sent continuously without interruption to model generation.
If there is a need to mix data interleaved across the BidiGenerateContentClientContent and the BidiGenerateContentRealtimeInput, the server attempts to optimize for best response, but there are no guarantees.
End of turn is not explicitly specified, but is rather derived from user activity (for example, end of speech).
Even before the end of turn, the data is processed incrementally to optimize for a fast start of the response from the model.
Fields
mediaChunks[]	
Blob

Optional. Inlined bytes data for media input. Multiple mediaChunks are not supported, all but the first will be ignored.

DEPRECATED: Use one of audio, video, or text instead.

audio	
Blob

Optional. These form the realtime audio input stream.

video	
Blob

Optional. These form the realtime video input stream.

activityStart	
ActivityStart

Optional. Marks the start of user activity. This can only be sent if automatic (i.e. server-side) activity detection is disabled.

activityEnd	
ActivityEnd

Optional. Marks the end of user activity. This can only be sent if automatic (i.e. server-side) activity detection is disabled.

audioStreamEnd	
bool

Optional. Indicates that the audio stream has ended, e.g. because the microphone was turned off.

This should only be sent when automatic activity detection is enabled (which is the default).

The client can reopen the stream by sending an audio message.

text	
string

Optional. These form the realtime text input stream.

BidiGenerateContentServerContent
Incremental server update generated by the model in response to client messages.

Content is generated as quickly as possible, and not in real time. Clients may choose to buffer and play it out in real time.

Fields
generationComplete	
bool

Output only. If true, indicates that the model is done generating.

When model is interrupted while generating there will be no 'generation_complete' message in interrupted turn, it will go through 'interrupted > turn_complete'.

When model assumes realtime playback there will be delay between generation_complete and turn_complete that is caused by model waiting for playback to finish.

turnComplete	
bool

Output only. If true, indicates that the model has completed its turn. Generation will only start in response to additional client messages.

interrupted	
bool

Output only. If true, indicates that a client message has interrupted current model generation. If the client is playing out the content in real time, this is a good signal to stop and empty the current playback queue.

groundingMetadata	
GroundingMetadata

Output only. Grounding metadata for the generated content.

inputTranscription	
BidiGenerateContentTranscription

Output only. Input audio transcription. The transcription is sent independently of the other server messages and there is no guaranteed ordering.

outputTranscription	
BidiGenerateContentTranscription

Output only. Output audio transcription. The transcription is sent independently of the other server messages and there is no guaranteed ordering, in particular not between serverContent and this outputTranscription.

urlContextMetadata	
UrlContextMetadata

modelTurn	
Content

Output only. The content that the model has generated as part of the current conversation with the user.

BidiGenerateContentServerMessage
Response message for the BidiGenerateContent call.

Fields
usageMetadata	
UsageMetadata

Output only. Usage metadata about the response(s).

Union field messageType. The type of the message. messageType can be only one of the following:
setupComplete	
BidiGenerateContentSetupComplete

Output only. Sent in response to a BidiGenerateContentSetup message from the client when setup is complete.

serverContent	
BidiGenerateContentServerContent

Output only. Content generated by the model in response to client messages.

toolCall	
BidiGenerateContentToolCall

Output only. Request for the client to execute the functionCalls and return the responses with the matching ids.

toolCallCancellation	
BidiGenerateContentToolCallCancellation

Output only. Notification for the client that a previously issued ToolCallMessage with the specified ids should be cancelled.

goAway	
GoAway

Output only. A notice that the server will soon disconnect.

sessionResumptionUpdate	
SessionResumptionUpdate

Output only. Update of the session resumption state.

BidiGenerateContentSetup
Message to be sent in the first (and only in the first) BidiGenerateContentClientMessage. Contains configuration that will apply for the duration of the streaming RPC.

Clients should wait for a BidiGenerateContentSetupComplete message before sending any additional messages.

Fields
model	
string

Required. The model's resource name. This serves as an ID for the Model to use.

Format: models/{model}

generationConfig	
GenerationConfig

Optional. Generation config.

The following fields are not supported:

responseLogprobs
responseMimeType
logprobs
responseSchema
stopSequence
routingConfig
audioTimestamp
systemInstruction	
Content

Optional. The user provided system instructions for the model.

Note: Only text should be used in parts and content in each part will be in a separate paragraph.

tools[]	
Tool

Optional. A list of Tools the model may use to generate the next response.

A Tool is a piece of code that enables the system to interact with external systems to perform an action, or set of actions, outside of knowledge and scope of the model.

realtimeInputConfig	
RealtimeInputConfig

Optional. Configures the handling of realtime input.

sessionResumption	
SessionResumptionConfig

Optional. Configures session resumption mechanism.

If included, the server will send SessionResumptionUpdate messages.

contextWindowCompression	
ContextWindowCompressionConfig

Optional. Configures a context window compression mechanism.

If included, the server will automatically reduce the size of the context when it exceeds the configured length.

inputAudioTranscription	
AudioTranscriptionConfig

Optional. If set, enables transcription of voice input. The transcription aligns with the input audio language, if configured.

outputAudioTranscription	
AudioTranscriptionConfig

Optional. If set, enables transcription of the model's audio output. The transcription aligns with the language code specified for the output audio, if configured.

proactivity	
ProactivityConfig

Optional. Configures the proactivity of the model.

This allows the model to respond proactively to the input and to ignore irrelevant input.

BidiGenerateContentSetupComplete
This type has no fields.

Sent in response to a BidiGenerateContentSetup message from the client.

BidiGenerateContentToolCall
Request for the client to execute the functionCalls and return the responses with the matching ids.

Fields
functionCalls[]	
FunctionCall

Output only. The function call to be executed.

BidiGenerateContentToolCallCancellation
Notification for the client that a previously issued ToolCallMessage with the specified ids should not have been executed and should be cancelled. If there were side-effects to those tool calls, clients may attempt to undo the tool calls. This message occurs only in cases where the clients interrupt server turns.

Fields
ids[]	
string

Output only. The ids of the tool calls to be cancelled.

BidiGenerateContentToolResponse
Client generated response to a ToolCall received from the server. Individual FunctionResponse objects are matched to the respective FunctionCall objects by the id field.

Note that in the unary and server-streaming GenerateContent APIs function calling happens by exchanging the Content parts, while in the bidi GenerateContent APIs function calling happens over these dedicated set of messages.

Fields
functionResponses[]	
FunctionResponse

Optional. The response to the function calls.

BidiGenerateContentTranscription
Transcription of audio (input or output).

Fields
text	
string

Transcription text.

ContextWindowCompressionConfig
Enables context window compression — a mechanism for managing the model's context window so that it does not exceed a given length.

Fields
Union field compressionMechanism. The context window compression mechanism used. compressionMechanism can be only one of the following:
slidingWindow	
SlidingWindow

A sliding-window mechanism.

triggerTokens	
int64

The number of tokens (before running a turn) required to trigger a context window compression.

This can be used to balance quality against latency as shorter context windows may result in faster model responses. However, any compression operation will cause a temporary latency increase, so they should not be triggered frequently.

If not set, the default is 80% of the model's context window limit. This leaves 20% for the next user request/model response.

EndSensitivity
Determines how end of speech is detected.

Enums
END_SENSITIVITY_UNSPECIFIED	The default is END_SENSITIVITY_HIGH.
END_SENSITIVITY_HIGH	Automatic detection ends speech more often.
END_SENSITIVITY_LOW	Automatic detection ends speech less often.
GoAway
A notice that the server will soon disconnect.

Fields
timeLeft	
Duration

The remaining time before the connection will be terminated as ABORTED.

This duration will never be less than a model-specific minimum, which will be specified together with the rate limits for the model.

ProactivityConfig
Config for proactivity features.

Fields
proactiveAudio	
bool

Optional. If enabled, the model can reject responding to the last prompt. For example, this allows the model to ignore out of context speech or to stay silent if the user did not make a request, yet.

RealtimeInputConfig
Configures the realtime input behavior in BidiGenerateContent.

Fields
automaticActivityDetection	
AutomaticActivityDetection

Optional. If not set, automatic activity detection is enabled by default. If automatic voice detection is disabled, the client must send activity signals.

activityHandling	
ActivityHandling

Optional. Defines what effect activity has.

turnCoverage	
TurnCoverage

Optional. Defines which input is included in the user's turn.

SessionResumptionConfig
Session resumption configuration.

This message is included in the session configuration as BidiGenerateContentSetup.sessionResumption. If configured, the server will send SessionResumptionUpdate messages.

Fields
handle	
string

The handle of a previous session. If not present then a new session is created.

Session handles come from SessionResumptionUpdate.token values in previous connections.

SessionResumptionUpdate
Update of the session resumption state.

Only sent if BidiGenerateContentSetup.sessionResumption was set.

Fields
newHandle	
string

New handle that represents a state that can be resumed. Empty if resumable=false.

resumable	
bool

True if the current session can be resumed at this point.

Resumption is not possible at some points in the session. For example, when the model is executing function calls or generating. Resuming the session (using a previous session token) in such a state will result in some data loss. In these cases, newHandle will be empty and resumable will be false.

SlidingWindow
The SlidingWindow method operates by discarding content at the beginning of the context window. The resulting context will always begin at the start of a USER role turn. System instructions and any BidiGenerateContentSetup.prefixTurns will always remain at the beginning of the result.

Fields
targetTokens	
int64

The target number of tokens to keep. The default value is trigger_tokens/2.

Discarding parts of the context window causes a temporary latency increase so this value should be calibrated to avoid frequent compression operations.

StartSensitivity
Determines how start of speech is detected.

Enums
START_SENSITIVITY_UNSPECIFIED	The default is START_SENSITIVITY_HIGH.
START_SENSITIVITY_HIGH	Automatic detection will detect the start of speech more often.
START_SENSITIVITY_LOW	Automatic detection will detect the start of speech less often.
TurnCoverage
Options about which input is included in the user's turn.

Enums
TURN_COVERAGE_UNSPECIFIED	If unspecified, the default behavior is TURN_INCLUDES_ONLY_ACTIVITY.
TURN_INCLUDES_ONLY_ACTIVITY	The users turn only includes activity since the last turn, excluding inactivity (e.g. silence on the audio stream). This is the default behavior.
TURN_INCLUDES_ALL_INPUT	The users turn includes all realtime input since the last turn, including inactivity (e.g. silence on the audio stream).
UrlContextMetadata
Metadata related to url context retrieval tool.

Fields
urlMetadata[]	
UrlMetadata

List of url context.

UsageMetadata
Usage metadata about response(s).

Fields
promptTokenCount	
int32

Output only. Number of tokens in the prompt. When cachedContent is set, this is still the total effective prompt size meaning this includes the number of tokens in the cached content.

cachedContentTokenCount	
int32

Number of tokens in the cached part of the prompt (the cached content)

responseTokenCount	
int32

Output only. Total number of tokens across all the generated response candidates.

toolUsePromptTokenCount	
int32

Output only. Number of tokens present in tool-use prompt(s).

thoughtsTokenCount	
int32

Output only. Number of tokens of thoughts for thinking models.

totalTokenCount	
int32

Output only. Total token count for the generation request (prompt + response candidates).

promptTokensDetails[]	
ModalityTokenCount

Output only. List of modalities that were processed in the request input.

cacheTokensDetails[]	
ModalityTokenCount

Output only. List of modalities of the cached content in the request input.

responseTokensDetails[]	
ModalityTokenCount

Output only. List of modalities that were returned in the response.

toolUsePromptTokensDetails[]	
ModalityTokenCount

Output only. List of modalities that were processed for tool-use request inputs.

Ephemeral authentication tokens
Ephemeral authentication tokens can be obtained by calling AuthTokenService.CreateToken and then used with GenerativeService.BidiGenerateContentConstrained, either by passing the token in an access_token query parameter, or in an HTTP Authorization header with "Token" prefixed to it.

CreateAuthTokenRequest
Create an ephemeral authentication token.

Fields
authToken	
AuthToken

Required. The token to create.

AuthToken
A request to create an ephemeral authentication token.

Fields
name	
string

Output only. Identifier. The token itself.

expireTime	
Timestamp

Optional. Input only. Immutable. An optional time after which, when using the resulting token, messages in BidiGenerateContent sessions will be rejected. (Gemini may preemptively close the session after this time.)

If not set then this defaults to 30 minutes in the future. If set, this value must be less than 20 hours in the future.

newSessionExpireTime	
Timestamp

Optional. Input only. Immutable. The time after which new Live API sessions using the token resulting from this request will be rejected.

If not set this defaults to 60 seconds in the future. If set, this value must be less than 20 hours in the future.

fieldMask	
FieldMask

Optional. Input only. Immutable. If field_mask is empty, and bidiGenerateContentSetup is not present, then the effective BidiGenerateContentSetup message is taken from the Live API connection.

If field_mask is empty, and bidiGenerateContentSetup is present, then the effective BidiGenerateContentSetup message is taken entirely from bidiGenerateContentSetup in this request. The setup message from the Live API connection is ignored.

If field_mask is not empty, then the corresponding fields from bidiGenerateContentSetup will overwrite the fields from the setup message in the Live API connection.

Union field config. The method-specific configuration for the resulting token. config can be only one of the following:
bidiGenerateContentSetup	
BidiGenerateContentSetup

Optional. Input only. Immutable. Configuration specific to BidiGenerateContent.

uses	
int32

Optional. Input only. Immutable. The number of times the token can be used. If this value is zero then no limit is applied. Resuming a Live API session does not count as a use. If unspecified, the default is 1.
