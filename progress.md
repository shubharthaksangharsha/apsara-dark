# Apsara Dark — Progress

## v0.1.0 — Initial UI Shell (Feb 9, 2026)

### What was done

- **Project setup**: Android Jetpack Compose project with Kotlin, Material 3, targeting SDK 35 (min SDK 26).
- **Dark theme**: Custom `ApsaraDarkTheme` — true-black surfaces (`#0D0D0D`), purple accent (`#B388FF`), custom color palette and typography.
- **Navigation drawer** (hamburger menu):
  - Slide-from-left or tap hamburger icon to open.
  - Items: My Canvas, Latest Videos, My Plugins (with badge), Laptop Control, Settings.
  - Status footer showing version and online state.
- **Main interface**:
  - Top app bar with Apsara avatar, app name, and online status.
  - Greeting section with user name.
  - 2×2 feature card grid: **Talk**, **Design**, **Control**, **Reminders** — each with icon, title, and subtitle.
  - Recent conversation section with mock chat bubbles (user + Apsara).
- **Bottom input bar**:
  - Text input with placeholder ("Ask Apsara anything…").
  - Attach button (+ icon).
  - Mic button (when empty) / Send button (when text is entered).
  - Focus-aware animated border.
- **Mock data**: Sample chat messages, drawer items, and feature cards — all using mock data, no backend yet.
- **Debug APK**: Successfully assembled at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

- **Removed "Online · Ready"** status from top bar — clean look.
- **Drawer cleanup**:
  - Removed "Apsara / Your AI companion" header and close button.
  - Removed "Latest Videos" item.
  - Removed plugin badge count.
  - Removed bottom "v0.1.0 — Online" status footer.
  - Items now: My Canvas, My Plugins, Laptop Control, Settings.

## v0.3.0 — Theme System (Feb 9, 2026)

### What was done

- **8 VS Code-inspired themes**: Dark (default), Monokai, Nightly, Solarized, Dracula, Nord, Light, Monochrome.
- **Settings screen**: Accessible from drawer → Settings. Shows a scrollable list of theme cards.
- **Each theme card** shows: 3 color preview dots, theme name, dark/light label, mini preview bar, and a check indicator for the active theme.
- **ThemeManager**: Singleton that persists theme choice to SharedPreferences — survives app restarts.
- **All components refactored**: HomeScreen, AppDrawer, FeatureCard, BottomInputBar all read from `LocalThemeManager` — no more hardcoded colors.
- **Dynamic status/nav bar**: System bars update color and light/dark appearance per theme.

### New files

- `ui/theme/AppThemes.kt` — all 8 palette definitions
- `ui/theme/ThemeManager.kt` — state holder + SharedPreferences persistence + CompositionLocal
- `ui/screens/SettingsScreen.kt` — theme picker UI

## v1.0.2 — UI Polish & Layout Refinements (Feb 9, 2026)

### What was done

- **Home screen redesigned**:
  - Removed greeting ("Good evening, Shubharthak") — replaced with centered "Apsara is here for you!" tagline.
  - Removed Apsara logo and animated title from top bar — just a clean hamburger icon now.
  - Feature grid (Talk, Design, Control, Reminders) — minimal text-only chips, no icons, 2×2 centered grid.
- **Drawer updated**:
  - Apsara logo moved to top of drawer (above menu items).
  - Clean layout: logo → My Canvas, My Plugins, Laptop Control, Settings.
- **Bottom input bar polish**:
  - Placeholder changed to "Ask Apsara".
  - Input bar raised higher from the bottom edge for better thumb reach.
  - Added spacing between mic and live icons for cleaner look.
  - Separate `+` attach button on the left, input box curves fully to the right.
- **Settings themes**: Expandable/collapsible grid layout, theme names only (no color dots, no previews, no icons).
- **Feature cards**: Stripped to just names — no icons, no subtitles. Minimal pill-style chips.
